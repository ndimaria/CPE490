4/19/2019 Update:
A simple chat application has been implemented to run on 18.219.224.83:3000 when the instance is up. Next the team will write a simple html game and host that on the server.

4/23/2019 Update:
Code was created for the controller to be read and recognized as well as the screen to be shared and hosted.

4/24/2019 Update:
Chat application was modified to read in inputs from left/right/up/down keys on keyboard for support. The team is working on getting support for gamepads to be read such as Xbox 360 controllers and screen sharing implementation.

4/25/2019 Update:
Chat application no longer responds to keyboard inputs while focus is in the text box. Started using the Gamepad API for controller support.
To Do: remove unnecessary HTML coding and differentiate between different button presses.
